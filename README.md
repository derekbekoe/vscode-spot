Spot is a VS Code extension that provides an integrated terminal, file explorer and editor to any container image with terminal access through the browser also.

- VS Code Extension
    - Terminal, File Explorer, File Editing, Notifications, Status Bar

- Secure access over HTTPS
- In-browser access

## Quickstart

A few steps to get you started right away.

#### Azure File Share

Set up an Azure File Share with the following files at the root of the file share:  
    - https://vscodespot.blob.core.windows.net/preview/spot-host  
    - https://vscodespot.blob.core.windows.net/preview/pty.node  
    - https://vscodespot.blob.core.windows.net/preview/certbot.sh  

#### Configuration

| Name | Description |
| --- |---|
| `spot.azureResourceGroup`     | The resource group to deploy spots into.
| `spot.azureStorageAccountName`    | The storage account name containing the file share.
| `spot.azureStorageAccountKey` | The storage account key for the storage account.
| `spot.azureFileShareName1`  | The file share name containing the spot host.
| `spot.azureFileShareName2`  | (optional) The file share name you want to mount for persistent storage.
| `spot.createSpotWithSSLEnabled`  | (optional) Create new spots with SSL enabled. Disable this if you are having issues with Let's Encrypt.

See [User and Workspace Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) on how to set these configuration values in VS Code.

#### Log in to Azure

If not already logged in, log in to Azure inside VS Code with `Azure: Log In`.
Use `Azure: Select Subscriptions` to select an appropriate subscription.

#### Create a Spot

Create a Spot with `Spot: Create`.

When done, `Spot: Disconnect` and then `Spot: Terminate` to shut down the instance.

:exclamation: Spot utilizes [Azure Container Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/). See [Container Instances pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/container-instances/) for their pricing information.

:warning: When you're done with a spot, save any files in persistent storage and **terminate** the spot.

    - Currently, there is no cross-file Intellisense or debugging
- Image pull time
    - Large container images can take a couple minutes to start.
- Reliability / Resilience
    - Better handling of loss of connectivity is yet to come.
- Only Linux containers are supported
    - We hope to lift this limitation in the future.
